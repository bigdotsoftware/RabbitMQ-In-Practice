## A Complete Guide to RabbitMQ, Queues, Exchanges, Producers and Consumers, Patterns, Clustering, Optimization & Tune-up

This course will guide you through the features and limitation or RabbitMQ. Course contains a lot of practical knowledge, examples and hands-on lectures. 

If you are a beginner, don't worry, course guides you from very generic concept of queues to more advanced features. If you already have experience with RabbitMQ, you will enjoy the advanced part of it. Maybe you are in the middle and not sure if you are using RabbitMQÂ correctly? If so, then course will help you find answers to that questions, optionally grounding and strengthening your exiting experience. No matter what is your existing level of knowledge, after completing this course, you will be ready to become a true professional in the RabbitMQ community.

In this course, I will show you how to configure, administrate, and properly use RabbitMQ. We'll start by forming a cluster and installing plugins. Then we will go through the details of the AMQP protocol, different types of queues, exchanges, virtual hosts, security features etc.

I will show you typical RabbitMQ patterns like work queues, publish subscribe, RPC, dead letter exchanges (DLX), delayed scheduling etc. 

We will also tune-up sample cluster and analyze memory usage by running performance tests. We'll simulate failures, like partitions, and I'll show you how to fix them and properly protect your cluster. 

Overall, you'll learn how to build highly available and fault-tolerant clusters in the easy way, without spending hours reading manuals.

I hope to see you in the first lecture.
